# detris

This project contains my first attempt at using the clojure language.  

Disclaimer: It's a work in progress, which means the output is not correct, which means there are still test failures.
However, now that I know the basics, I look forward to learning more about this powerful language!  Having been a Java programmer for the past decade, I'm really enjoying learning other languages - especially the functional ones like Clojure and Scala.

The application is a simplified game of Tetris played from reading the "input.txt" file for the moves.  Each line represents a new board.   Basically, it has all the basic principles you love about the original game, but dummied down so there's no rotating or horizontal movement of pieces.

## Installation

I'm using Clojure 1.5.1

Also, if you don't have lein, one of the ways to install is like this:
> cd; wget https://raw.github.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
> sudo cp lein /usr/bin/lein
> sudo chmod ugo+rx /usr/bin/lein

## Usage

The app takes no arguments, and requires that an "input.txt" exists in the project directory (the project already provides one of these).  The results will be written to "output.txt" at the same location.

To run using Leiningen: 
> lein run

To build the the uberjar: 
> lein uberjar

To run with the uberjar (from the base project dir):
> java -jar target/drw-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar

Note: Currently, the output.txt is appended to on each run.  Until I clean up the file programmatically, just do a remove before the run:
> rm -f output.txt
